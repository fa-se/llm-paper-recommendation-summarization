    "dk = dv = dmodel/h = 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\n",
    "is similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\n",
    "3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\n",
    "The Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\n",
    "• In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\n",
    "and the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\n",
    "position in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\n",
    "typical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\n",
    "[38, 2, 9].\n",
    "• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\n",
    "and queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\n",
    "encoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\n",
    "encoder.\n",
    "• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\n",
    "all positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\n",
    "information ﬂow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\n",
    "inside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\n",
    "of the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\n",
    "3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\n",
    "In addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\n",
    "connected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\n",
    "consists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\n",
    "FFN(x) = max(0, xW1 + b1)W2 + b2 (2)\n",
    "While the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\n",
    "from layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\n",
    "The dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality\n",
    "df f = 2048.\n",
    "3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\n",
    "Similarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\n",
    "tokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\n",
    "mation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\n",
    "our model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\n",
    "linear transformation, similar to [ 30 ]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √dmodel.\n",
    "3.5 Positional Encoding\n",
    "Since our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the\n",
    "order of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the\n",
    "5\n",
    "Table 1: Maximum path lengths, per-layer complexity and minimum number of sequential operations\n",

    "size of convolutions and r the size of the neighborhood in restricted self-attention.\n",

    "tokens in the sequence. To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\n",
    "bottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\n",
    "as the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,\n",
    "learned and ﬁxed [9].\n",
    "In this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\n",
    "P E(pos,2i) = sin(pos/100002i/dmodel )\n",
    "P E(pos,2i+1) = cos(pos/100002i/dmodel )\n",
    "where pos is the position and i is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\n",
    "corresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2π to 10000 · 2π. We\n",
    "chose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\n",
    "relative positions, since for any ﬁxed offset k, P Epos+k can be represented as a linear function of\n",
    "P Epos.\n",
    "We also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two\n",
    "versions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\n",
    "because it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\n",
    "during training.\n",
    "4 Why Self-Attention\n",

    "(x1, ..., xn) to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., zn), with xi, zi ∈ Rd, such as a hidden\n",
    "layer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\n",
    "consider three desiderata.\n",
    "One is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\n",
    "be parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\n",
    "The third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\n",
    "dependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\n",
    "ability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\n",
    "traverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\n",
    "and output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare\n",
    "the maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\n",
    "different layer types.\n",
    "As noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\n",
    "executed operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations. In terms of\n",
    "computational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\n",
    "length n is smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with\n",
    "sentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece\n",
    "[38 ] and byte-pair [31 ] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving\n",
    "very long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size r in\n",
    "6\n",
    "the input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum\n",
    "path length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\n",
    "A single convolutional layer with kernel width k < n does not connect all pairs of input and output\n",
    "positions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\n",
    "or O(logk(n)) in the case of dilated convolutions [ 18], increasing the length of the longest paths\n",
    "between any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\n",
    "recurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [6 ], however, decrease the complexity\n",
    "considerably, to O(k · n · d + n · d2). Even with k = n, however, the complexity of a separable\n",
    "convolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,\n",
    "the approach we take in our model.\n",
    "As side beneﬁt, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions\n",

    "5 Training\n",
    "This section describes the training regime for our models.\n",
    "5.1 Training Data and Batching\n",
    "We trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million\n",
    "sentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [3], which has a shared source-\n",
    "target vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the signiﬁcantly larger WMT\n",
    "2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\n",
    "vocabulary [38 ]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\n",

    "5.2 Hardware and Schedule\n",
    "We trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\n",

    "5.4 Regularization\n",
    "We employ three types of regularization during training:\n",
    "Residual Dropout We apply dropout [33 ] to the output of each sub-layer, before it is added to the\n",

    "model outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\n",
    "We are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We\n",
    "plan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and\n",
    "to investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efﬁciently handle large inputs and outputs\n",
